This variable is very useful when deploying a new scraping task after an old one was completed. In that case, the adage should be set to a low value to prevent rescraping data that was already scraped with the last scraping task. However, even if duplicates are scraped, they won't be added to the scraped_data, but are dropped immediately. Therefore, this variable just helps to make the loop more efficient.\n",
